# INTRODUCING LISTS
- learn what list are and how to work with elements in a list
- list allow you to store sets of information in one place
- list: "a collectio of items in a particular order"

# NOTES
Adding to the end of a list:
list.append('element')

Inserting into an element into a list (where 0 represents an index):
list.insert(0,'element')


Removing from a list:
del list[0] -- deletes an element and no longer have access 
list.pop -- removes or pops the last element in list
list.pop(#) -- pops an element from the specified index  
list.remove('element') -- remove when we don't know the index of the value -- removes only the first occurance of this value
